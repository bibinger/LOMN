R code for replication of simulations from "Jump detection in high-frequency order prices"

Disclaimer:
This collection of R-code (augmented by cpp-functions) serves the reproduction of the 
simulations presented in the manuscript "Jump detection in high-frequency order prices" 
written by Markus Bibinger, Nikolaus Hautsch and Alexander Ristig. The latter author 
prepared this collection of R-code. Without permission of the author, the code must not 
be re-distributed or used for commercial purposes.


Software:
The code required for the reproduction of the simulations is (mainly) written in the R 
language and delivered in form of scripts. The software recommended below is available 
under the license GPL-3. The results presented in the manuscript were computed in R 
under version 4.0.1 â€” 'See Things Now'. The following packages were used: Rcpp 
(version: 1.0.4.6) as well as RcppZiggurat (version: 0.1.5). Moreover, the provided 
cpp-based-functions 'rep_col', 'rep_row', 'row_min' and 'row_max' originate from the 
R package Rfast (version: 1.9.9), written by Manos Papadakis, Michail Tsagris, 
Marios Dimitriadis, Stefanos Fafalios, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Matteo Fasiolo, 
Giorgos Borboudakis, John Burkardt, Changliang Zou, Kleanthi Lakiotaki 
and Christina Chatzipantsiou. (2020).

Instructions to reproduce the simulation studies:
The simulation studies can be reproduced by running the corresponding scripts
'sim_global_test_one_only.R','sim_global_test_mmn_vs_lomn.R' and 'sim_local.R'. 
These files in turn load the functions of the R-script 'sim_functions.R' and the cpp-script 
'fct.cpp'. The results have to be summarized by averaging, e.g., by colMeans().
